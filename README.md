Hi, Iâ€™m Stefano, a Web developer based in Prague who is trying his best into this :computer: world.
I like to code in React and JS, but I am always learning and practising in order to remember what I know and get to have fun and code in more programming languages.
Nowadays my working day is full of Sharepoint, Typescript, Js and React.

If you want to reach for a chat or whatever, I am sure you will find a way ðŸ‘€
